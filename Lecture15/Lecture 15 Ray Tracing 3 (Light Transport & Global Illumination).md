## Lecture 15: Ray Tracing 3 (Light Transport & Global Illumination)

###  Irradiance 

Irradience at surface is proportional to cosine of angle between light direction and surface point.



### Radiance

The radiance (luminance) is the power emitted reflected, transmitted or received by a surface,per unit solid angle,per projected unit area.



### Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)



### Reflection Equation
