### Lecture 6: Rasterization2 (Antialiasing and Z-Buffering)



### Aliasing



#### Sampling Artifacts in Computer Graphics

Artifacts due to sampling - Aliasing



Behind the Aliasing Artifacts

â€‹	Signals are changing too fast (high frequency) but sampled too slowly





### Antialiasing

### Frequency Domain



Filtering  =  Getting rid of certain frequency Domain

Filtering = Convolution (= Averaging)

Sampling  = Repeating Frequency Contents

Aliasing = Mixed Frequency Contents



How Can We Reduce Aliasing Error ?

Option 1:  Increase sampling rate

Option 2: Antialiasing    Filtering out high frequencies before sampling





### Anitaliasing By Supersampling (MSAA)
