### Lecture 8: Shading 2 (Shading, Pipeline and Texture Mapping)

#### Last Lecture

##### Shading 1

 - Blinn-Phong reflectance model
   -  Diffuse
   - Specular
   - Ambient

At a specific shading point 



##### Shading 2

​	Blinn-Phong reflectance model

​		-Specular and ambient terms

​	Shading frequencies

​	Graphics pipeline





#### Specular Term （Blinn-Phong）

​	Intensity depends on view direction

​		Bright near mirror reflection direction

​		V close to mirror direction  = half vector near normal

​		Measure "near" by dot product of unit vectors



### Ambient Term

​		shading that does not depend on anything





### Blinne-Phong Reflection Model

​	Ambient  + Diffuse + Specular = Blinne-Phong Reflection

​	



### Shading Frequencies

	##### 	Shade each triangle (flat shading)

	##### 	Shade each vertex (Gouraud shading)

    #####     Phong shading （pixel shading）

​	



#### Graphics (Real-time Rendering) Pipeline

​	



### Texture mapping 





### Goal: Highly Complex 3D Scenes in Realtime
