## Lecture 14: Ray Tracing 2 (Acceleration & Radiometry)



### Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs)



### Uniform Spatial Partitions (Grids)

- Build Acceleration Grid
  - 1. Find bounding box
    2. Create grid
    3. Store each object in overlapping cells



### Radiant Energy and Flux (Power) 

​	$Q[J = Joule]$

​	$\Phi=\frac{dQ}{dt} [W =Watt][lm=lumen]^{*}$
